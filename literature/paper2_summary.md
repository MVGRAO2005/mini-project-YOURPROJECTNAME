# Paper Summary: EfficientNet (2019)

## Problem
Scaling networks manually is inefficient.

## Method
Compound scaling of depth, width, and resolution.

## Strengths
- High accuracy with fewer parameters
- Fast training

## Weaknesses
- Needs TPU for large variants

## Notes
Ideal for our project due to efficiency.
