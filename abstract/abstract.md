# Project Abstract

## Title
Deep Learning Based Detection of Lung Abnormalities from Chest X-ray Images

## Problem Statement
Early detection of lung diseases is crucial but manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to errors.

## Objective
To build an efficient deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into disease categories.

## Methodology
1. Collect dataset
2. Preprocess images
3. Train CNN/EfficientNet model
4. Evaluate performance

## Expected Outcome
An automated system that classifies X-ray images with high accuracy.
